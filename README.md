# Hadassah PicoCTF 2024 write-ups

We, members of the 2024 class of Information Security at Hadassah college solving multiple challenges in the PicoCTF 2024 CTF.

# For students

1. Choose the challenge you want to solve [here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=1&page=1), **note it needs to be at least for 100 points and it needs to be a challenge others are not working on**
2. Open a pull request on this file by adding yourself to the section "Who is doing what?" bellow, create the related directories and readme and point to with the link. (just I did ðŸ˜‰), **see **the notes **below**!!!****
3. When I approve the pull request you can start to work on the challenge (**do not start to work on the challenge before I approve**, this is important so you will work on your own challenge that others are not working on and won't be rejected on the grounds that someone else already doing the same challenge)
4. Your task is done when you completed your write-up, sent me the second pull request and I accepted it.

See [here](https://github.com/slashben/hadassah-picoctf-2023-writeups) how it worked last year!

## Notes about the first and second pull request
1. In the first pull request, add your name and challenge to this file as I did under "Who is doing what?" section - this enables others to see which challenge is already taken
2. In the second pull request, open a directory under [writeups/web-exploitation](/writeups/web-exploitation) with the name of your challenge
3. In the second pull request put a README.md into the above directory where you explain your solution (see my example [here](https://github.com/slashben/hadassah-picoctf-2023-writeups/tree/main/writeups/web-exploitation/GET%20aHEAD)), if you used code like python, add it to the same directory
4. Don't use docx format, go according to the example
