The puzzle is a map. 
If I go to the starting point and then go back I can actually run over the characters that are written there and change the values of the variables there.
If I use the Ghidra, I can get the source code and realize that there is a variable that when equals to 'p' ends the game. 
There I run over the variable with the value of 'p' and get the flag that way.

The key is picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_f3416ca2}!
