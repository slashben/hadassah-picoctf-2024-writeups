# RPS 
This is the write-up for the challenge "RPS" from picoCTF.

# The challenge

## Description
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you.
I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/146/game-redacted.c).

## Hints
How does the program check if you won?

## Initial look
I looked at the code and realized that there is a problem with the way it defines a win.
The problem is that it uses the strstr function and searches for the input I entered, a substring that is contained in the list of all options

# How to solve it
I came to the conclusion that if we input the entire list of options (rock/paper/scissors) as input every time, then I will always win

That's how I actually won 5 victories and got the flag.

So the flag is: picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_B69E01B8}
